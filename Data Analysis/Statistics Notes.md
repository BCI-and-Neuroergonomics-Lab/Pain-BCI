# Planned Statistical Analysis:

### Number of Samples per Subject, per Condition, and per Stimulus

| *Subject N*    | Pain | Haptic | Baseline |
|----------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Attention**  | 60   | 60     | 60       |
| **Distracted** | 60   | 60     | 60       |

* a 3x2 mixed effects model, with Baseline really just there as a sanity check
* a mixed effects model, with subject as a random factor (controls for subject specific brain patterns *and* subject specific pain thresholds)
* ensure counterbalance with an even number of subjects doing each Condition first
